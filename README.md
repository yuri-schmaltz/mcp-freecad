## Install addon

FreeCAD Addon directory is
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Mod\`
* Mac:
  * FreeCAD 1.1: `~/Library/Application\ Support/FreeCAD/v1-1/Mod/`
  * FreeCAD 1.0: `~/Library/Application\ Support/FreeCAD/v1-0/Mod/`
* Linux:
  * Ubuntu: `~/.FreeCAD/Mod/` or `~/snap/freecad/common/Mod/` (if you install FreeCAD from snap)
  * Debian: `~/.local/share/FreeCAD/Mod`
  * Arch / CachyOS (FreeCAD 1.1 from `extra/freecad`): `~/.local/share/FreeCAD/v1-1/Mod/`

Please put `addon/FreeCADMCP` directory to the addon directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp.git
cd freecad-mcp

# For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
cp -r addon/FreeCADMCP ~/.FreeCAD/Mod/

# For Linux (Arch/CachyOS, FreeCAD 1.1 from extra/freecad)
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/FreeCAD/v1-1/Mod/
cp -r addon/FreeCADMCP ~/.local/share/FreeCAD/v1-1/Mod/

# For macOS (FreeCAD 1.1)
cp -r addon/FreeCADMCP ~/Library/Application\ Support/FreeCAD/v1-1/Mod/
```

When you install addon, you need to restart FreeCAD.
You can select "MCP Addon" from Workbench list and use it.

And you can start RPC server by "Start RPC Server" command in "FreeCAD MCP" toolbar.

![start_rpc_server](./assets/start_rpc_server.png)

### Auto-Start RPC Server

By default, the RPC server must be started manually each time FreeCAD opens. To start it automatically:

1. Open the **FreeCAD MCP** menu (switch to the MCP Addon workbench first)
2. Check **Auto-Start Server**

The setting is saved to `freecad_mcp_settings.json` and persists across sessions. On the next FreeCAD launch, the RPC server will start automatically once the application finishes loading.

You can disable it at any time by unchecking **Auto-Start Server** in the same menu.

## Setting up Claude Desktop

Pre-installation of the [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) is required.

And you need to edit Claude Desktop config file, `claude_desktop_config.json`.

For user.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "freecad-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to save token, you can set `only_text_feedback` to `true` and use only text feedback.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "freecad-mcp",
        "--only-text-feedback"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


For developer.
First, you need clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp.git
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/freecad-mcp/",
        "run",
        "freecad-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Remote Connections

By default the RPC server does not accept remote connections and listens on `localhost`. To control FreeCAD from another machine on your network:

### 1. Enable remote connections in FreeCAD

In the **FreeCAD MCP** toolbar:

1. Check **Remote Connections** — the RPC server will bind to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) on the next restart. For security reasons, it only accepts connections from the IP addresses or CIDR subnets specified in the **Allowed IPs** field. By default this is `127.0.0.1`.
2. Click **Configure Allowed IPs** and enter a comma-separated list of IP addresses or CIDR subnets that are allowed to connect, e.g.:

   ```
   192.168.1.100, 10.0.0.0/24
   ```

   `127.0.0.1` is always the default. Invalid entries are rejected with an error dialog. Restart the RPC server after changing these settings.

### 2. Point the MCP server at the remote host

Pass the `--host` flag with the IP address or hostname of the machine running FreeCAD:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "freecad-mcp",
        "--host", "192.168.1.100"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `--host` value is validated on startup — it must be a valid IPv4/IPv6 address or hostname.

## Tools

* `create_document`: Create a new document in FreeCAD.
* `create_object`: Create a new object in FreeCAD.
* `edit_object`: Edit an object in FreeCAD.
* `delete_object`: Delete an object in FreeCAD.
* `execute_code`: Execute arbitrary Python code in FreeCAD.
* `insert_part_from_library`: Insert a part from the [parts library](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library).
* `get_view`: Get a screenshot of the active view.
* `get_objects`: Get all objects in a document.
* `get_object`: Get an object in a document.
* `get_parts_list`: Get the list of parts in the [parts library](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library).
* `run_fem_analysis`: Run the CalculiX solver on an existing `Fem::FemAnalysis` and return summary results (max von Mises stress, max displacement, node count, working directory). Auto-creates a `SolverCcxTools` if the analysis has none. See [`examples/cantilever_fem.py`](examples/cantilever_fem.py) for an end-to-end usage example.

## Guidelines & Logging

This project now integrates directives from `docs/gabarito_ia.pdf` (extracted to `docs/gabarito_ia_extracted.txt`) and enforces them at runtime:

- The application will prefix textual responses with the mandated sentence from the gabarito.
- Dangerous or "agreement trap" prompts (e.g. requests to bypass safety, or code that calls `os.system`) are detected and refused with constructive guidance.
- Logging is configurable via the `FREECAD_MCP_LOGLEVEL` environment variable (default `INFO`).
- Logs are written to console and to `logs/freecad_mcp.log` (rotating file handler).

## Running tests

There is a small test runner which validates the guidelines enforcement and basic operation handlers. Run locally with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -u tests/run_guidelines_tests.py
```

CI is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run the same tests on push and pull requests (Python 3.12).
